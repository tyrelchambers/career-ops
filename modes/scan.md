# Mode: scan — Portal Scanner (Offer Discovery)

Scans configured job portals, filters by title relevance, and adds new offers to the pipeline for later evaluation.

> **Note (v1.5+):** The default scanner (`scan.mjs` / `npm run scan`) is **zero-token** and only hits the public Greenhouse, Ashby, and Lever APIs directly. The Playwright/WebSearch levels described below are the **agent** flow (run by Claude/Codex), not what `scan.mjs` does. If a company has no Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever API, `scan.mjs` will skip it; for those cases, the agent should manually complete Level 1 (Playwright) or Level 3 (WebSearch).

## Recommended execution

Run as a subagent to avoid consuming main context:

```
Agent(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="[content of this file + specific data]",
    run_in_background=True
)
```

## Configuration

Read `portals.yml` which contains:
- `search_queries`: List of WebSearch queries with `site:` filters per portal (broad discovery)
- `tracked_companies`: Specific companies with `careers_url` for direct navigation
- `title_filter`: Positive/negative/seniority_boost keywords for title filtering

## Discovery strategy (3 levels)

### Level 1 — Direct Playwright (PRIMARY)

**For each company in `tracked_companies`:** Navigate to its `careers_url` with Playwright (`browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`), read ALL visible job listings, and extract title + URL from each one. This is the most reliable method because:
- Sees the page in real time (no cached Google results)
- Works with SPAs (Ashby, Lever, Workday)
- Detects new offers instantly
- Does not depend on Google indexing

**Each company MUST have `careers_url` in portals.yml.** If it doesn't, find it once, save it, and use it in future scans.

### Level 2 — ATS APIs / Feeds (COMPLEMENTARY)

For companies with a public API or structured feed, use the JSON/XML response as a fast complement to Level 1. Faster than Playwright and reduces visual scraping errors.

**Current support (variables in `{}`):**
- **Greenhouse**: `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{company}/jobs`
- **Ashby**: `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR**: list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; job detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Lever**: `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor**: `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday**: `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**Parsing convention by provider:**
- `greenhouse`: `jobs[]` → `title`, `absolute_url`
- `ashby`: GraphQL `ApiJobBoardWithTeams` with `organizationHostedJobsPageName={company}` → `jobBoard.jobPostings[]` (`title`, `id`; build public URL if not in payload)
- `bamboohr`: list `result[]` → `jobOpeningName`, `id`; build detail URL `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`; to read the full JD, GET the detail and use `result.jobOpening` (`jobOpeningName`, `description`, `datePosted`, `minimumExperience`, `compensation`, `jobOpeningShareUrl`)
- `lever`: root array `[]` → `text`, `hostedUrl` (fallback: `applyUrl`)
- `teamtailor`: RSS items → `title`, `link`
- `workday`: `jobPostings[]`/`jobPostings` (depending on tenant) → `title`, `externalPath` or URL built from host

### Level 3 — WebSearch queries (BROAD DISCOVERY)

The `search_queries` with `site:` filters cover portals transversally (all Ashby, all Greenhouse, etc.). Useful for discovering NEW companies not yet in `tracked_companies`, but results may be outdated.

**Execution priority:**
1. Level 1: Playwright → all `tracked_companies` with `careers_url`
2. Level 2: API → all `tracked_companies` with `api:`
3. Level 3: WebSearch → all `search_queries` with `enabled: true`

Levels are additive — all run, results are merged and deduplicated.

## Workflow

1. **Read configuration**: `portals.yml`
2. **Read history**: `data/scan-history.tsv` → already-seen URLs
3. **Read dedup sources**: `data/applications.md` + `data/pipeline.md`

4. **Level 1 — Playwright scan** (parallel in batches of 3-5):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `enabled: true` and `careers_url` defined:
   a. `browser_navigate` to the `careers_url`
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read all job listings
   c. If the page has filters/departments, navigate relevant sections
   d. For each job listing extract: `{title, url, company}`
   e. If the page paginates results, navigate additional pages
   f. Accumulate in candidates list
   g. If `careers_url` fails (404, redirect), try `scan_query` as fallback and note for URL update

5. **Level 2 — ATS APIs / feeds** (parallel):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `api:` defined and `enabled: true`:
   a. WebFetch the API/feed URL
   b. If `api_provider` is defined, use its parser; if not defined, infer by domain (`boards-api.greenhouse.io`, `jobs.ashbyhq.com`, `api.lever.co`, `*.bamboohr.com`, `*.teamtailor.com`, `*.myworkdayjobs.com`)
   c. For **Ashby**, send POST with:
      - `operationName: ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
      - `variables.organizationHostedJobsPageName: {company}`
      - GraphQL query for `jobBoardWithTeams` + `jobPostings { id title locationName employmentType compensationTierSummary }`
   d. For **BambooHR**, the list only returns basic metadata. For each relevant item, read `id`, GET `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`, and extract the full JD from `result.jobOpening`. Use `jobOpeningShareUrl` as the public URL if available; otherwise use the detail URL.
   e. For **Workday**, send POST JSON with at least `{"appliedFacets":{},"limit":20,"offset":0,"searchText":""}` and paginate by `offset` until results are exhausted
   f. For each job extract and normalize: `{title, url, company}`
   g. Accumulate in candidates list (dedup with Level 1)

6. **Level 3 — WebSearch queries** (parallel if possible):
   For each query in `search_queries` with `enabled: true`:
   a. Run WebSearch with the defined `query`
   b. From each result extract: `{title, url, company}`
      - **title**: from the result title (before the " @ " or " | ")
      - **url**: result URL
      - **company**: after " @ " in the title, or extract from domain/path
   c. Accumulate in candidates list (dedup with Level 1+2)

6. **Filter by title** using `title_filter` from `portals.yml`:
   - At least 1 keyword from `positive` must appear in the title (case-insensitive)
   - 0 keywords from `negative` must appear
   - `seniority_boost` keywords add priority but are not required

7. **Deduplicate** against 3 sources:
   - `scan-history.tsv` → exact URL already seen
   - `applications.md` → normalized company + role already evaluated
   - `pipeline.md` → exact URL already in pending or processed

7.5. **Verify liveness of WebSearch results (Level 3)** — BEFORE adding to pipeline:

   WebSearch results may be outdated (Google caches results for weeks or months). To avoid evaluating expired offers, verify with Playwright each new URL from Level 3. Levels 1 and 2 are inherently real-time and don't require this verification.

   For each new Level 3 URL (sequential — NEVER Playwright in parallel):
   a. `browser_navigate` to the URL
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read the content
   c. Classify:
      - **Active**: job title visible + role description + Apply/Submit button
      - **Expired** (any of these signals):
        - Final URL contains `?error=true` (Greenhouse redirects this way when offer is closed)
        - Page contains: "job no longer available" / "no longer open" / "position has been filled" / "this job has expired" / "page not found"
        - Only navbar and footer visible, no JD content (content < ~300 chars)
   d. If expired: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_expired` and discard
   e. If active: continue to step 8

   **Do not interrupt the entire scan if one URL fails.** If `browser_navigate` errors (timeout, 403, etc.), mark as `skipped_expired` and continue.

8. **For each new verified offer that passes filters**:
   a. Add to `pipeline.md` "Pending" section: `- [ ] {url} | {company} | {title}`
   b. Record in `scan-history.tsv`: `{url}\t{date}\t{query_name}\t{title}\t{company}\tadded`

9. **Offers filtered by title**: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_title`
10. **Duplicate offers**: record with status `skipped_dup`
11. **Expired offers (Level 3)**: record with status `skipped_expired`

## Title and company extraction from WebSearch results

WebSearch results come in format: `"Job Title @ Company"` or `"Job Title | Company"` or `"Job Title — Company"`.

Extraction patterns by portal:
- **Ashby**: `"Senior AI PM (Remote) @ EverAI"` → title: `Senior AI PM`, company: `EverAI`
- **Greenhouse**: `"AI Engineer at Anthropic"` → title: `AI Engineer`, company: `Anthropic`
- **Lever**: `"Product Manager - AI @ Temporal"` → title: `Product Manager - AI`, company: `Temporal`

Generic regex: `(.+?)(?:\s*[@|—–-]\s*|\s+at\s+)(.+?)$`

## Private URLs

If a non-publicly accessible URL is found:
1. Save the JD to `jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md`
2. Add to pipeline.md as: `- [ ] local:jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md | {company} | {title}`

## Scan History

`data/scan-history.tsv` tracks ALL seen URLs:

```
url	first_seen	portal	title	company	status
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	PM AI	Acme	added
https://...	2026-02-10	Greenhouse — SA	Junior Dev	BigCo	skipped_title
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	SA AI	OldCo	skipped_dup
https://...	2026-02-10	WebSearch — AI PM	PM AI	ClosedCo	skipped_expired
```

## Output summary

```
Portal Scan — {YYYY-MM-DD}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Queries run: N
Offers found: N total
Filtered by title: N relevant

## careers_url management

Each company in `tracked_companies` must have `careers_url` — the direct URL to their job listings page. This avoids searching for it every time.

**RULE: Always use the company's corporate careers URL; fall back to the ATS endpoint only if no corporate page exists.**

`careers_url` must point to the company's own careers page whenever available. Many companies use Workday, Greenhouse, or Lever under the hood but only expose job IDs through their corporate domain. Using the direct ATS URL when a corporate page exists can cause false 410 errors because job IDs don't match.

| ✅ Correct (corporate) | ❌ Wrong as first choice (direct ATS) |
|---|---|
| `https://careers.mastercard.com` | `https://mastercard.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com` |
| `https://openai.com/careers` | `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/openai` |
| `https://stripe.com/jobs` | `https://jobs.lever.co/stripe` |

Fallback: if you only have the direct ATS URL, first navigate to the company's website and locate its corporate careers page. Use the direct ATS URL only if the company has no corporate careers page.

**Known patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}`
- **Greenhouse:** `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}` or `https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/{slug}`
- **Lever:** `https://jobs.lever.co/{slug}`
- **BambooHR:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Teamtailor:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs`
- **Workday:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/{site}`
- **Custom:** The company's own URL (e.g., `https://openai.com/careers`)

**API/feed patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby API:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR API:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail` (`result.jobOpening`)
- **Lever API:** `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor RSS:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday API:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**If `careers_url` doesn't exist** for a company:
1. Try the pattern for its known platform
2. If that fails, do a quick WebSearch: `"{company}" careers jobs`
3. Navigate with Playwright to confirm it works
4. **Save the found URL in portals.yml** for future scans

**If `careers_url` returns 404 or redirect:**
1. Note in the output summary
2. Try scan_query as fallback
3. Flag for manual update

## portals.yml maintenance

- **ALWAYS save `careers_url`** when adding a new company
- Add new queries as new portals or interesting roles are discovered
- Disable queries with `enabled: false` if they generate too much noise
- Adjust filter keywords as target roles evolve
- Add companies to `tracked_companies` when you want to follow them closely
- Periodically verify `careers_url` — companies change ATS platforms
